This Playground was created so viewers of Tim Beaudet's Indie Adventure could try out Track Builder and explore through various bugs to report.

## Setup

1. git clone playground.git repository.
2. Download TrackBuilder ([here](https://tyrebytes.com/t/track_builder/track_builder_v0.2.5.zip) talk with Tim)
3. Run TrackBuilder and choose File > New Project and navigate to playground/playground.exe
4. Good luck! (the playground.exe is not a valid executable, it doesn't actually matter here).
