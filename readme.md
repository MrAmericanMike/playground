This Playground was created so viewers of Tim Beaudet's Indie Adventure could try out Track Builder and explore through various bugs to report.

# playground.exe is NOT an executable!

It is there to allow Track Builder to choose the project area, since Track Builder can work on multiple games/projects.

## Setup

1. git clone playground.git repository.
2. Download TrackBuilder ([here](https://tyrebytes.com/t/track_builder/track_builder_windows.zip) talk with Tim)
3. Run TrackBuilder and choose File > New Project and navigate to playground/playground.exe
4. Good luck! (the playground.exe is not a valid executable, it doesn't actually matter here).


## Basic Controls

Middle-mouse + mouse + WASD will fly camera around.
  (if the camera is automatically moving on middle mouse, try slightly resizing the screen; horizontally for left movement or vertically for up movement, or both :D)
  
TAB (changes mode, only testing Primary Editor Mode which has the "Scene Editor")
Shortcuts (G)rab, (R)otate, (S)cale

## Submitting an Issue

If you submit an issue here for Track Builder stuff start it with: `TrackBuilder: ... ` like: `TrackBuilder: Camera is stuck moving around`.
