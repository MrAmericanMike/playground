This Playground was created so viewers of Tim Beaudet's Indie Adventure could try out Track Builder and explore through various bugs to report.

## Setup

1. git clone playground.git repository.
2. Download TrackBuilder (talk with Tim)
3. Run TrackBuilder and choose File > New Project and navigate to playground/playground.exe
4. Good luck (the playground.exe is not a valid executable).
